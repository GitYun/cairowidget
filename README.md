# cairowidget
cairo widget for FLTK. Before you decide to use this example, be aware that the code illustrates just one possible way to use cairo in your project. There is an official fltk solution available, but support for that is not compiled into the library in many distributions. You should carefully look into whether the approach taken here suffices for your needs - there are other possible approaches to this problem.

I also added support for cairo's OpenGL backend (CairoWindow). This will make for blazingly fast renders of graphs and other gui elements.
